# Nearest Neighbors

The Turi Create [nearest neighbors
toolkit](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/turicreate.toolkits.nearest_neighbors.html)
is used to find the rows in a data table that are most similar to a
query row. This is a two-stage process, analogous to many other Turi
Create toolkits. First we create a
[NearestNeighborsModel](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.nearest_neighbors.NearestNeighborsModel.html),
using a **reference dataset** contained in an
[XFrame](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.XFrame.html).
Next we query the model, using either the `query` or the
`similarity_graph` method. Each of these methods is explained further
below.

For this chapter we use an example dataset of house attributes and prices:

```python
import turicreate as tc
sf = tc.XFrame.read_csv('houses.csv')
sf.head(5)
```
```no-highlight
+------+---------+------+--------+------+-------+
| tax  | bedroom | bath | price  | size |  lot  |
+------+---------+------+--------+------+-------+
| 590  |    2    | 1.0  | 50000  | 770  | 22100 |
| 1050 |    3    | 2.0  | 85000  | 1410 | 12000 |
|  20  |    3    | 1.0  | 22500  | 1060 |  3500 |
| 870  |    2    | 2.0  | 90000  | 1300 | 17500 |
| 1320 |    3    | 2.0  | 133000 | 1500 | 30000 |
+------+---------+------+--------+------+-------+
[5 rows x 6 columns]
```

Because the features in this dataset have very different scales (e.g. price is
in the hundreds of thousands while the number of bedrooms is in the single
digits), it is important to **normalize the features**. In this example we
standardize so that each feature is measured in terms of standard deviations
from the mean (see [Wikipedia for more
detail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_%28statistics%29)). In
addition, both reference and query datasets may have a column with row labels,
but for this example we let the model default to using row indices as labels.

```python
for c in sf.column_names():
    sf[c] = (sf[c] - sf[c].mean()) / sf[c].std()
```

First, we **create a nearest neighbors model**. We can list specific features to
use in our distance computations, or default to using all features in the
reference XFrame. In the model summary below the following code snippet, note
that there are three features, because our second command specifies three
numeric XFrame columns as features for the model. There are also three unpacked
features, because each feature is in its own column.

```python
model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf)
model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, features=['bedroom', 'bath', 'size'])
model.summary()
```

To retrieve the five closest neighbors for *new* data points or a *subset* of
the original reference data, we **query** the model with the `query` method.
Query points must also be contained in an XFrame, and must have columns with the
same names as those used to construct the model (additional columns are allowed,
but ignored). The result of the `query` method is an XFrame with four columns:
query label, reference label, distance, and rank of the reference point among
the query point's nearest neighbors.

```python
knn = model.query(sf[:5], k=5)
knn.head()
```

```

In some cases the query dataset *is* the reference dataset. For this task of
constructing the **similarity_graph** on the reference data, the model's
`similarity_graph` can be used. For brute force models it can be almost twice as
fast, depending on the data sparsity and chosen distance function. By default,
the `similarity_graph` method returns an
[SGraph](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SGraph.html)
whose vertices are the rows of the reference dataset and whose edges indicate a
nearest neighbor match. Specifically, the destination vertex of an edge is a
nearest neighbor of the source vertex. `similarity_graph` can also return
results in the same form as the `query` method if so desired.

```python
sim_graph = model.similarity_graph(k=3)
```

#### Distance functions

The most critical choice in computing nearest neighbors is the
**distance function** that measures the dissimilarity between any pair
of observations.

For numeric data, the options are ``euclidean``, ``manhattan``,
``cosine``, and ``transformed_dot_product.`` For data in dictionary
format (i.e. sparse data), ``jaccard`` and ``weighted_jaccard`` are also
options, in addition to the numeric distances. For string features, use
``levenshtein`` distance, or use the text analytics toolkit's
``count_ngrams`` feature to convert strings to dictionaries of words or
character shingles, then use Jaccard or weighted Jaccard distance.
Leaving the distance parameter set to its default value of ``auto``
tells the model to choose the most reasonable distance based on the type
of features in the reference data. In the following output cell, the
second line of the model summary confirms our choice of Manhattan
distance.

```python
model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, features=['bedroom', 'bath', 'size'],
                                    distance='manhattan')
model.summary()
```

Distance functions are also exposed in the ``turicreate.distances``
module. This allows us not only to specify the distance argument for a
nearest neighbors model as a distance function (rather than a string),
but also to *use* that function for any other purpose.

In the following snippet we use a nearest neighbors model to find the
closest reference points to the first three rows of our dataset, then
confirm the results by computing a couple of the distances manually with
the Manhattan distance function.

```python
model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, features=['bedroom', 'bath', 'size'],
                                    distance=tc.distances.manhattan)
knn = model.query(sf[:3], k=3)
knn.print_rows()

sf_check = sf[['bedroom', 'bath', 'size']]
print("distance check 1:", tc.distances.manhattan(sf_check[2], sf_check[10]))
print("distance check 2:", tc.distances.manhattan(sf_check[2], sf_check[14]))
```

Turi Create also allows **composite distances**, which allow the nearest
neighbors tool (and other distance-based tools) to work with features
that have different types. Specifically, a composite distance is a
*weighted sum of standard distances applied to subsets of features*,
specified in the form of a Python list. Each element of a composite
distance list contains three things:

  1. a list or tuple of feature names
  2. a standard distance name
  3. a multiplier for the standard distance.

In our house price dataset, for example, suppose we want to measure the
difference between numbers of bedrooms and baths with Manhattan distance
and the difference between house and lot sizes with Euclidean distance.
In addition, we want the Euclidean component to carry twice as much
weight. The composite distance for this would be:

```python
my_dist = [[['bedroom', 'bath'], 'manhattan', 1],
           [['size', 'lot'], 'euclidean', 2]]
```

This list can be passed to the ``distance`` parameter just like a standard
distance function name or handle.

```python
model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, distance=my_dist)
model.summary()
```
```no-highlight
Class                         : NearestNeighborsModel

Number of examples            : 15
Number of feature columns     : 4
Number of unpacked features   : 4
Total training time (seconds) : 0.0017
```

If we specify the distance parameter as ``auto``, a composite distance
is created where each type of feature is paired with the most
appropriate distance function. Please see the documentation for the
[Turi Create distances
module](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/turicreate.toolkits.distances.html)
for more on composite distances.

#### Search methods

Another important choice in model creation is the **method**. The
``brute_force`` method computes the distance between a query point and *each* of
the reference points, with a run time linear in the number of reference points.
Creating a model with the ``ball_tree`` method takes more time, but leads to
much faster queries by partitioning the reference data into successively smaller
balls and searching only those that are relatively close to the query.  The
default method is ``auto`` which chooses a reasonable method based on both the
feature types and the selected distance function. The method parameter is also
specified when the model is created. The third row of the model summary confirms
our choice to use the ball tree in the next example.

```python
model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, features=['bedroom', 'bath', 'size'],
                                    method='ball_tree', leaf_size=5)
model.summary()
```
```no-highlight
Class                         : NearestNeighborsModel

Attributes
----------
Method                        : ball_tree
Number of distance components : 1
Number of examples            : 15
Number of feature columns     : 3
Number of unpacked features   : 3
Total training time (seconds) : 0.0253

Ball Tree Attributes
--------------------
Tree depth                    : 3
Leaf size                     : 5
```

If the ball tree is used, it's important to choose an appropriate value for the
'leaf_size' parameter, which controls how many observations are stored in each
leaf of the ball tree. By default, this is set so that the tree is no more than
12 levels deep, but larger or smaller values may lead to quicker queries
depending on the shape and dimension of the data. Our houses example only has 15
rows, so the ``leaf_size`` parameter (and the ``ball_tree`` method for that
matter) are not too useful, but for illustration purposes we set the leaf size
to 5 above.

#### Missing data

The reference dataset that is used to create the nearest neighbors model
cannot have missing data. Please use the
[XFrame.fillna](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.XFrame.fillna.html)
and
[XFrame.dropna](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SArray.dropna.html)
utilities to preprocess missing values before creating a nearest
neighbors model.

On the other hand, data passed to the `query` method *can* have missing
data.  For numeric columns, missing values are imputed to be the mean of
the corresponding column in the reference dataset used to create the
model. Missing values in string columns are imputed as empty strings.
