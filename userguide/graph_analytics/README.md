# Introduction to Graph Analytics

Going from inspiration to production with graph models requires knowledge of several of the graph's attributes:
influential and outlier nodes, clusters and communities, hidden
connections between nodes, and the ability to compare different graphs based on
these attributes. The
[Graph Analytics toolkit](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/turicreate.toolkits.graph_analytics.html)
enables this depth of understanding by providing several methods:

- [Connected components](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.connected_components.create.html)
- [Graph coloring](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.graph_coloring.create.html)
- [K-Core decomposition](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.kcore.create.html)
- [PageRank](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.pagerank.create.html)
- [Single-source shortest path](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.shortest_path.create.html)
- [Triangle count](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.triangle_counting.create.html#turicreate.triangle_counting.create)

Each method takes an input graph and returns a model object, which contains the
run time, an XFrame with the desired output for each vertex, and a new graph
whose vertices contain the output as an attribute.


# Examples

To illustrate some of these methods, we'll use a previously created SGraph where
vertices represent Wikipedia articles for  US businesses and edges represent
hyperlinks between articles.

```python
import turicreate
sg = turicreate.load_sgraph('US_business_links')

print(sg.summary())
```
```no-highlight
{'num_edges': 517127, 'num_vertices': 233121}
```


##### PageRank

PageRank is an iterative algorithm to compute the most influential nodes in a
network. In each iteration, a vertex's influence is measured as the sum of
influence of the nodes that point at the vertex. Each node's score is updated
until the scores converge, or until the user-specified maximum number of
iterations is reached.

As with other Turi Create methods, the model object is constructed with
the `create` function. The `summary()` method provides a snapshot of the
result, and the `list_fields()` method gives the attributes of the model
that can be queried.

```python
pr = turicreate.pagerank.create(sg, max_iterations=10)
print(pr.summary())
```
```no-highlight

| delta             | Change in pagerank for the last iteration in L1 norm      |
| reset_probability | The probability of randomly jumps to any node in the graph|
| pagerank          | An XFrame with each vertex's pagerank                     |
| num_iterations    | Number of iterations                                      |

| max_iterations    | The maximum number of iterations to run                   |
+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

The model fields are retrieved either with the `get` method or by
treating the model as a dictionary, as in the following snippet, which
shows the model creation run time of about 7 seconds.

```python
print(pr['training_time'])
```
```no-highlight
7.234136
```

The `pagerank` field contains an XFrame with the per-node pagerank score. For
this example of Wikipedia articles and hyperlinks, ABC takes the top spot by a
large margin.

```python
pr_out = pr['pagerank']
print(pr_out.topk('pagerank', k=10))
```

##### Triangle counting

The number of triangles in a vertex's immediate neighborhood is a measure of the
"density" of the vertex's neighborhood. In both of the figures below, vertex A
has three immediate neighbors, ignoring edge directions. In the top figure, none
of node A's neighbors is connected to any other neighbor, indicating a very
loosely connected network. In contrast, all of the three neighbors are connected
to each other in the bottom figure, indicating a tightly connected network.

In this dataset, there is a lot of overlap between the companies with large
influence in the Wikipedia article network (as measured by PageRank) and the
companies with the largest and most dense neighborhoods, as measured by the
triangle count method, but there are notable differences. ABC has only the sixth
most triangles despite having the highest pagerank, while Microsoft ranks very
high by both statistics, suggesting the Microsoft article is slightly more
central in the network.

tri_out = tri['triangle_count']
print(tri_out.topk('triangle_count', k=10))

##### Single-source shortest path

Paths in a graph are a sequence of vertices, where each consecutive pair is
connected by an edge in the graph. The single-source shortest path problem is to
find the shortest path from all vertices in the graph to a user-specified target
node. The source vertex with the smallest distribution of shortest paths can be
considered the most central node in the graph.

Because Turi Create SGraphs use directed edges, the shortest path toolkit
also finds the shortest directed paths to a source vertex. In this example we
find all shortest paths to the node for the Microsoft article, then visualize
the shortest path from the Microsoft article to the Weyerhauser article.
We find the quickest way to get from Microsoft to Weyerhauser is via the
articles on Google.

```python
sssp = turicreate.shortest_path.create(sg, source_vid='Microsoft')
sssp.get_path(vid='Weyerhaeuser',
              highlight=['Microsoft', 'Weyerhaeuser'], arrows=True, ewidth=1.5)
```
```no-highlight
[('Microsoft', 0.0),
 ('Google', 1.0),
 ('Weyerhaeuser', 3.0)]
```
