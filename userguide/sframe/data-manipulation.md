# Data Manipulation

It isn't often that your dataset is "clean" enough to run one of our
toolkits on it in a meaningful way right after import.  Such is
life...data is messy.  XFrames enable you to complete data cleaning
tasks in a scalable way, even on datasets that are much larger than your
computer's memory.


#### Column Selection and Manipulation

A problem you may have noticed in the song metadata is that some songs'
year value is 0.  Suppose we want to change those to a missing value, so
that they do not skew a summary statistic over the column (e.g. `mean`
or `min`). If we knew about this before parsing, or are willing to parse
the file again, we could add 0 to the `na_values` option of `read_csv`.
Alternatively, we can apply an arbitrary function to one or multiple
columns of an XFrame.  Here's how to replace those zeroes with missing
values with a Python lambda function:

```python
songs['year'] = songs['year'].apply(lambda x: None if x == 0 else x)
songs.head(5)
```
```
+--------------------+----------------------+--------------------------------+

|   Yerba Brava    | 2003 |
|    Der Mystic    | None |
+------------------+------+
[5 rows x 5 columns]
```

Notice we had to reassign the resulting column back to our XFrame.  This
is because the content of the XFrame's columns (a separate data
structure called an
[SArray](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SArray.html)) 
is immutable.  XFrames can add and subtract columns liberally though, as
it essentially is just a carrier of references to SArrays.

We used a lambda function here because it is the simplest way to
instantiate a small function like that.  The `apply` method will take a
named function (a normal Python function that starts with `def`) as
well.  As long as the function takes one parameter and returns one
value, it can be applied to a column.

We can also apply a function to multiple columns.  Suppose we want to
add a column of the number of times the word 'love' is used in the
`title` and `artist` column:

```python
songs['love_count'] = songs[['title', 'artist_name']].apply(
    lambda row: sum(x.lower().split(' ').count('love') for x in row.values()))
songs.topk('love_count', k=5)
```


```

[5 rows x 6 columns]
```

A few things to note here.  We first select a subset of columns
using a list within square brackets.  This is useful in general, but it helps us
with performance in this case, as fewer values are scanned.  Also, when apply is
called on an XFrame instead of an SArray as shown here, the input of the lambda
function is a dictionary where the keys are the column names, and the values
correspond to that row's values.

Another very useful and common operation is the ability to select
columns based on types.  For instance, this extracts all the columns
containing strings.

```python
songs[str]
```

```

Now, you may not feel comfortable transforming a column without inspecting more
than the first 10 rows of it, as we did with the `year` column. To quickly get
a summary of the column, we can do:

```python
songs['year'].summary()
```

```

It appears that there are no other bogus years than 0.  This summary splits
its values into "exact" and "approximate".  The approximate values could
certainly be returned as exact values, but for the summary we use approximate
values to make sure exploring large datasets is scalable.  The methods we use
only do a single pass of the data in the column, and each operation has well-
defined bounds on how wrong the answer will be, which are listed in our
[API Reference](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.Sketch.html).

Using the most frequent items and quantiles described here, you can probably
almost picture the distribution of years, where the tallest part is squarely
within the 2000s.  Fortunately, we don't have to just picture it in our heads.
Turi Create provides visualizations of XFrames, as well as other data
structures.  Turi Create visualization is covered in depth in the
[Visualization](../vis/README.md) section. To view a histogram of the
SArray, we run:

```
songs['year'].show()
```

![songs['year'].show()](images/xframe_user_guide_1_histogram.png)

We have done some exploration, transformation, and feature generation.  Let's
spend some time filtering values we won't care about later.  For example,
perhaps we'll need an XFrame with **only** dated songs.  This basic filter operation
looks like this:

```python
dated_songs = songs[songs['year'] != None]
dated_songs
```

```

[? rows x 6 columns]
Note: Only the head of the XFrame is printed. This XFrame is lazily evaluated.
You can use len(sf) to force materialization.
```

The output does a good job at explaining what is happening here.  XFrames will
not do any work if it isn't required right away.  This way, if you decide this
filter operation isn't for you after looking at the first few rows, Turi
Create won't waste computation time doing it anyways.  However, it
is important to verify that the missing values were indeed removed, and that we
indeed removed 484424 rows, so we'll force materialization of the new XFrame.

```python
len(dated_songs)
```

```
515576
```

Why does this filtering syntax work?  What we're actually doing is placing an
SArray in the square brackets.  A comparison operator applied to an SArray
returns a new SArray of the same length as the original, but with values that
correspond to `true` or `false` based on the operator.  Here's what it looks
like:


```python
songs['year'] != None
```

```
dtype: int
Rows: 1000000
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, ... ]
```


We may want to use more than one comparison operator, for which you must place
each comparison statement in parentheses and use the bitwise boolean logic
operators to combine the statements, as Python does not allow the overloading of
logical operators.  Perhaps we are building a music recommender with this data,
and we would like to only use "reasonable" play counts, for some definition of
reasonable:


```python
reasonable_usage = usage_data[(usage_data['listen_count'] >= 10) & (usage_data['listen_count'] <= 500)]
len(reasonable_usage)
```


```
114026
```

You can also write a lambda function to filter using the `filter` function,
which you can read about in the [API Reference](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/generated/turicreate.SArray.filter.html#turicreate.SArray.filter).

#### Joins and Aggregation

Another important way to filter a dataset is to get rid of duplicate
data.  A nice way to search for duplicate data is to visualize the
XFrame.

```
songs.show()
```

![songs.show()](images/xframe_user_guide_2_summary.png)

It appears our `song_id` is not completely unique.  This would make merging the
`songs` and `usage_data` XFrames error-prone if all we want to do is add song
title information to the existing usage data.  In this particular dataset, these
repeat songs are included because they may have been released on several
different albums (movie soundtracks, radio singles, etc.).  If we do not care
about which album release is included in the dataset, we can filter those
duplicates like this:


```python
other_cols = songs.column_names()
other_cols.remove('song_id')
agg_list = [tc.aggregate.SELECT_ONE(i) for i in other_cols]
unique_songs = songs.groupby('song_id', dict(zip(other_cols, agg_list)))
```

This code block needs some further explanation.  It is centered around calling
`groupby` with the `SELECT_ONE` aggregator.  This selects a random
representative row from each group.  You must explicitly denote which columns
will use this aggregator, so the list comprehension gathers all other columns
than the one we are grouping by and uses the `SELECT_ONE` aggregator for each
one.  When used like this, `SELECT_ONE` will use the same random row for each
column.  This is great if it is not important which of the duplicates you pick.
If it is, another aggregator like `MIN` or `MAX` may be in order.

Suppose we actually want to see the songs that have the highest play count?  Now
we can correctly group each song and aggregate its listen count, and then join
the result to the song metadata to see the song titles.

```python
usage_groups = usage_data.groupby(['song_id'], {'total_listens': tc.aggregate.SUM('listen_count'),
                                       'num_unique_users': tc.aggregate.COUNT('user_id')})
usage_groups.join(songs, ['song_id']).topk('total_listens')
```

The `usage_data` table is already in a great format for feeding to a
recommender algorithm as it has user and song identifiers, and some form
of a metric (number of listens) to rate how much the user liked the
song.  The problem here is that users that listened to a song a lot
would skew the recommendations.  At some point, once a user plays a song
enough times, you know they really like it.  Perhaps we could translate
the `listen_count` into a rating instead.  Here is a simple way to do
it:

```python
s = usage_data['listen_count'].summary()
import numpy
buckets = numpy.linspace(s.quantile(.005), s.quantile(.995), 5)
def bucketize(x):
    cur_bucket = 0
    for i in range(0,5):
        cur_bucket += 1
        if x <= buckets[i]:
            break
    return cur_bucket
usage_data['rating'] = usage_data['listen_count'].apply(bucketize)
usage_data
```

```

#### Working with Complex Types

SArrays are strongly-typed and some operations only work on certain types. Two
types deserve some special consideration in this user guide: `list` and `dict`.
These types can hold values of any type supported by SArrays, including
themselves. So you can have an XFrame with a column of dictionaries that each
have values that are lists of lists of dicts with mixed strings and
integers... anyway, you get the idea!

The dataset we're working with right now does not have any of these types, so we
can show how to convert one or several columns to one of these iterable types.
For instance, suppose we want a list of all albums with a list of each song that
was on the album.  We would obtain this list from our metadata like this:

```python
albums = songs.groupby(['release','artist_name'], {'tracks': tc.aggregate.CONCAT('title'),
                                                   'years': tc.aggregate.CONCAT('year')})
albums
```

The [CONCAT](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/turicreate.data_structures.html#module-turicreate.aggregate)
aggregator simply creates a list of all values in the given column for each
group.  I included the year for debugging purposes, since I didn't know if the
invariant of "every song on the same release has the same year" was true in
this dataset.  Even looking at the first row, this is clearly not true:

```python
albums[0]
```



```
{'artist_name': 'Veruca Salt',
 'release': 'Eight Arms To Hold You',
 'tracks': ['With David Bowie',
  'One Last Time',
  'The Morning Sad',
  'Awesome',
  'Stoneface',
  "Don't Make Me Prove It",
  'Straight',
  'Earthcrosser',
  'Benjamin',
  'Volcano Girls',
  'Shutterbug',
  'Sound Of The Bell',
  'Loneliness Is Worse',
  'Venus Man Trap'],
  'years': array('d', [1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1994.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0, 1997.0])}
```



In light of this complication, and for demonstration purposes, let's
have our 'tracks' column contain dictionaries instead, where the key is
the year and the value is a list of tracks.

```python
albums = songs.groupby(['release','artist_name','year'], {'tracks':tc.aggregate.CONCAT('title')})
albums = albums.unstack(column=['year','tracks'], new_column_name='track_dict')
albums
```

```

The `unstack` function is essentially a convenience function for calling
`groupby` on all other columns with the `CONCAT` aggregator.  This operation
can be undone with `stack`, which I won't take time to show in detail.

With our data organized this way, we can get some statistics on how many albums
have this oddity and see that it's actually somewhat prevalent for this to
occur:

```python
albums['num_years'] = albums['track_dict'].item_length()
albums['num_years'].show()
```

![albums['num_years'].show()](images/xframe_user_guide_3_categorical.png)

We can still recover the full track listing with some dict operations, so
suppose we want both a `list` and a `dict` representation of the tracks.

```python
albums['track_list'] = albums['track_dict'].dict_values()
albums
```

We have almost recovered our old column, but we have a list of lists instead of
just a single list.  Fixing that is a simple `apply` away:

```python
import itertools
albums['track_list'] = albums['track_list'].apply(lambda x: list(itertools.chain(*x)))
albums
```

We can also filter elements from within a list or dictionary.  Here is how to
remove all songs made in 1994 or 1999:

```python
albums['track_dict'] = albums['track_dict'].dict_trim_by_keys([1994, 1999])


albums
```

Since dictionaries are good for item lookups, we can filter by elements we
find in dictionaries.  Here is a query that filters  albums by whether any of
their songs came out in 1965:

```python
albums[albums['track_dict'].dict_has_any_keys(1965)]
```

Converting to a `list` or `dict` doesn't need to group by the rest of the values in
the row.  If for some reason you want to turn this into a table with one column
and all values packed into a list, you can!

```python
big_list = albums.pack_columns(albums.column_names())
big_list
```

The `unpack` function accomplishes the reverse task.  These examples may
be a bit contrived, but these functions are very useful when working
with unstructured data like text, as you will be able to see in the
[Text Analysis](../text/analysis.md) chapter of this guide.
